# Open Music

> "Music shouldn't make artists employees of tech corporations" - JME

Open Music is a Web3 music platform built to challenge the streaming paradigm. Inspired by British Grime artist JME's philosophy on music ownership, this platform enables artists to release music as limited-edition NFTs—restoring the intentionality and value of music ownership, just like vinyl records.

## Philosophy

Modern streaming platforms have commoditised music into background noise, turning artists into employees of tech giants. Open Music brings back **conscious music ownership**:

- Artists decide how many copies exist (scarcity = value)
- Fans **own** music forever, not rent access
- No platform fees—artists keep 50% per sale (the other 50% covers minting costs)
- Built on Base L2 for near-zero gas fees

## Features

### For Listeners

- **Own, don't stream** - Purchase limited-edition music releases
- **True ownership** - Your music library is yours forever (on-chain)
- **Seamless UX** - No "Web3 feel" - email login, credit card payments
- **YouTube Music-inspired interface** - Familiar, beautiful, fast

### For Artists

- **Full control** - Set your own supply and pricing
- **Real-time analytics** - Track sales by country, view top supporters
- **Direct relationship** - No intermediaries, no algorithmic manipulation
- **Mixtapes, EPs, Albums, Singles** - Release any format

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

- React 19 + TypeScript
- Tanstack Router + Query
- Zustand (state management)
- Tailwind CSS
- Privy (Web3 auth abstraction)

**Blockchain:**

- Base L2 (Ethereum)
- ERC-721 NFT standard
- USDC/USDT payments

**Design:**

- macOS-inspired UI (subtle curves, no thick borders)
- Black + Purple color palette
- Roboto + Inter typography

## Current Status

🚧 **Frontend Complete** - Fully functional UI with mock data  
⏳ **Smart Contracts** - In development  
⏳ **Backend API** - Planned

## Philosophy in Action

When you buy a $20 mixtape on Open Music:

- $10 goes to the artist immediately
- $10 covers the gas to mint and transfer the NFT to you
- You own 1 of X limited copies (set by the artist)
- The platform takes **zero fees** (holds 2 NFTs per release as payment)

## Inspiration

This project honours JME's vision expressed in interviews like his Gasworks appearance, where he critiques how streaming devalues music by making it "just a button press away." By bringing back intentional music consumption through ownership mechanics, Open Music bridges the cultural significance of vinyl with the possibilities of Web3.
